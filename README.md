This is a project that was made while I was in university.
It has some errors, but it runs perfectly and you can get a picture of the mechanics behind the project.
The goal of the project is to help novice librarians learn about the Dewey Decimal System in a more exciting way.
There are three game options: Replacing Books, Identifying Areas, and Finding Call Numbers.
